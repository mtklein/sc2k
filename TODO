- The overlays should display interesting information related to each in game system.
- We need more music tracks by the musician "Lowest ROAR", a low-fi fan of LOW ROAR.
- The game simulates fauna in its ecology too.
- Day/night cycle should be visible to players.
- Color changes should happen seasonally according to the mid-Atlantic climate we're set in.
- The landscapes are beautiful, impressionistic, idyllic.
- The game handles resizing well, including all overlays.
- Waves lap on the shores of bodies of water not surrounded by land.
- Traffic flow is simulated, and drawn on roads in proportion to their utilization in that network.
- Boats look like a child's drawing of a boat: a semicircle hull, with a triangle sail above.
- Boats can leave the edge of the screen without creating shipwrecks.
