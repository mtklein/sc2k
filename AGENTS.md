- For each change you make, update the in-game version number with either a
  major release (v4.1 -> v5.0) for changes with substantially new user-visible
  features, or a minor release (v4.1 -> v4.2) for tweaks and bugfixes.
- Keep TODO up to date, and add any new ideas you have that would make for
  delightful user experience to the list.  The game should be beautifully alive.
- When you complete a TODO, move it to FEATURES, and do a quick scan through
  FEATURES to make sure all the existing features still work.
